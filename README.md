# Cyber Threat Intel (CTI)

## Objective


This assignment from my CTI course at the University of Arizona tasked me with creating a threat actor profile on the Russian cybercrime group Wizard Spider.

### Skills Learned

-Collected and analyzed open-source intelligence (OSINT) to identify potential threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)

-Examined multiple data sources, such as threat feeds, logs, and reports, to find patterns and connect indicators of compromise (IOCs)

-Mapped threat actor behaviors to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to better understand their operational methodologies

-Compiled detailed and actionable threat profiles, including actor motives, resources, and historical activities, for stakeholders

-Evaluated threat actor motivations, targeting patterns, and geopolitical influences to predict future attack vectors

-Stayed updated on the latest threat intelligence trends and adapted profiling techniques to align with evolving cyber threats
